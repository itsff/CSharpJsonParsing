CSharpJsonParsing
=================

Example of JSON parsing and writing techniques using the open-source Json.NET library.

Checkout the [sample JSON data](https://github.com/itsff/CSharpJsonParsing/blob/master/CSharpJsonParsing/zuck.js)
(Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook profile),
and the [file actually doing the work](https://github.com/itsff/CSharpJsonParsing/blob/master/CSharpJsonParsing/Main.cs).

I wrote this on my MacBook Pro, but saved in Visual Studio 2012 solution format.
If you have VS 2010, simply open the .csproj file instead (it's in the subfolder).

But the point is to [read the code](https://github.com/itsff/CSharpJsonParsing/blob/master/CSharpJsonParsing/Main.cs).
